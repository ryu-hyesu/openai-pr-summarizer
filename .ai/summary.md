## 🤖 AI Change Summary for PR #1

### Chunk 1/1
### Overview
This change includes a modification to the `example.py` file and the addition of a new file named `trigger.txt`. The primary modification involves altering the input string for a response creation function.

### Key Changes
- **example.py**: The input string for the `client.responses.create` function has been changed from English ("Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.") to Korean ("테스트를 하는 게 정말 즐거워용!").
- **trigger.txt**: A new file has been added, but no specific content changes are provided in the diff.

### Risk/Impact
- The change in the input string may affect the output generated by the `client.responses.create` function, particularly if the model's performance varies based on language. This could lead to unexpected results if the model is not optimized for Korean.
- The addition of `trigger.txt` could imply new functionality or features that may need to be integrated or tested, depending on its intended use.

### Tests/Verification
- It is essential to run tests to verify that the response generation works correctly with the new Korean input. This includes checking for proper handling of the language and ensuring that the output meets expectations.
- Additionally, if `trigger.txt` is related to any functionality, tests should be created or updated to ensure that its integration does not introduce any issues.

### Follow-ups
- Review the performance of the model with the new input to ensure it meets the desired output quality.
- Clarify the purpose of `trigger.txt` and determine if any additional actions or tests are required based on its content or intended use.
