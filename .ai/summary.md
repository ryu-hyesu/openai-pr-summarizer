## 🤖 AI Change Summary for PR #1

### Chunk 1/1
### Overview
This change introduces a modification to the `example.py` file and adds a new file named `trigger.txt`. The primary focus is on updating the input string for a response generation function to a different language.

### Key Changes
- **example.py**: The input string for the `client.responses.create` function has been modified from English ("Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.") to Korean ("테스트를 하는 게 진짜 즐거툰듯??").
- **trigger.txt**: A new file has been added without any specified content changes in the diff.

### Risk/Impact
- The change in the input string may impact the output of the `client.responses.create` function, particularly if the model's performance varies with different languages. This could lead to unexpected results if the model is not well-optimized for Korean.
- The addition of `trigger.txt` suggests potential new functionality or features that may require further integration or testing, depending on its intended use.

### Tests/Verification
- It is crucial to run tests to ensure that the response generation functions correctly with the new Korean input, verifying proper language handling and output quality.
- If `trigger.txt` is associated with any functionality, relevant tests should be created or updated to confirm that its integration does not introduce any issues.

### Follow-ups
- Assess the model's performance with the new input to ensure it meets the expected output quality.
- Clarify the purpose of `trigger.txt` to determine if any additional actions or tests are necessary based on its content or intended use.
